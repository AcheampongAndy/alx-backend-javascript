# 0x03. ES6 Data Manipulation

## Project Overview

This project focuses on data manipulation using ES6 features in JavaScript. You will work with arrays, typed arrays, and various data structures such as `Set`, `Map`, and `WeakMap`. The project is designed to improve your understanding and ability to use functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` on arrays. You will also explore how ES6 handles typed arrays and weak links in data structures.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Use `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` to manipulate arrays.
- Understand and work with Typed Arrays.
- Utilize Set, Map, and WeakMap data structures.
- Explain how weak links are managed in JavaScript data structures.
