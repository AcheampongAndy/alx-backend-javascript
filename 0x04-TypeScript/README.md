# 0x04. TypeScript

This project focuses on learning and practicing TypeScript, a typed superset of JavaScript. The goal is to understand how TypeScript improves code quality by enforcing type safety and providing powerful features such as interfaces, classes, generics, and namespaces. All code written in this project will be transpiled and tested using `jest`.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts:

- **Basic Types in TypeScript**: Understand the use of static typing, including `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `array`, `tuple`, `enum`, `any`, `void`, `null`, `undefined`, and `never`.
- **Interfaces, Classes, and Functions**: Learn how to define and use interfaces to describe data shapes, implement classes with constructors and methods, and create functions with typed parameters and return types.
- **Working with the DOM in TypeScript**: Know how to manipulate the DOM using TypeScript and understand how types and interfaces apply to DOM elements.
- **Generic Types**: Explore how generics allow for reusable components that work with multiple types.
- **Namespaces**: Learn how to organize code using namespaces, allowing for modularity and better code management.
- **Declaration Merging**: Understand how TypeScript merges multiple declarations into a single definition for types, interfaces, and namespaces.
- **Ambient Namespaces**: Learn how to import external libraries into TypeScript using ambient declarations.
- **Nominal Typing**: Understand the concept of nominal typing and how it compares to structural typing in TypeScript.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`, `Visual Studio Code`
- All files should end with a new line.
- Code will be transpiled on **Ubuntu 18.04**.
- TypeScript code will be checked with **jest** (version 24.9.*).
- A `README.md` file is mandatory at the root of the project folder.
- All scripts should have a `.ts` extension.
- The TypeScript compiler should not display any errors or warnings when transpiling the code.

## Project Setup

1. Ensure that you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
