# ES6 Promises Project

## Overview

This project focuses on understanding and implementing ES6 Promises in JavaScript. It covers the fundamentals of promises, including how to create them, handle asynchronous operations, and manage errors. The project involves implementing functions that utilize promises to perform user profile signup with photo uploads and user creation.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain what promises are and their purpose in JavaScript.
- Use the `.then()`, `.resolve()`, and `.catch()` methods of the Promise object.
- Implement the `await` operator and use async functions.
- Handle errors gracefully with `throw` and `try/catch`.
- Understand every method of the Promise object.
