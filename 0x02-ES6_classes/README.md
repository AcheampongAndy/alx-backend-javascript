# 0x02. ES6 Classes and OOP in JavaScript

## Project Overview

This project focuses on understanding and implementing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts using ES6 Classes in JavaScript. You will learn how to define classes, add methods, utilize static methods, extend classes, and explore metaprogramming. The project will be executed on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using NodeJS 12.11.x, with code quality verified by ESLint and tests written in Jest.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain and implement the following concepts without external references:
- How to define a class in JavaScript.
- How to add methods to a class.
- Why and how to add static methods to a class.
- How to extend a class from another class.
- The basics of metaprogramming and symbols in JavaScript.

## Requirements

- Your files will be executed on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using NodeJS 12.11.x.
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`, `Visual Studio Code`.
- Each file should end with a new line.
- The root folder of the project must contain a `README.md` file (this file).
- Your code should use the `.js` extension.
- Your code will be tested using Jest (`npm run test`).
- Your code must adhere to ESLint rules (`npm run lint`).
- All code must pass the provided tests and linting checks (`npm run full-test`).

## Project Setup

### Step 1: Install NodeJS 12.11.x

Run the following commands to set up NodeJS in your home directory:

```bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh
sudo apt install nodejs -y
