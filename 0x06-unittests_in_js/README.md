# 0x06. Unittests in JavaScript

## Description
This project focuses on implementing unit tests in JavaScript to ensure the reliability and correctness of applications. You will use tools like **Mocha**, **Chai**, and **Sinon** to write, structure, and execute your test cases. Additionally, you will learn how to write integration tests for small Node.js servers.

By completing this project, you will understand how to use testing frameworks and libraries to catch bugs early and maintain code quality.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Use **Mocha** to write a test suite.
- Use different assertion libraries, including Node.js's built-in assertions and **Chai**.
- Write and organize long test suites for better readability and maintainability.
- Understand and use **spies** and **stubs** effectively.
- Utilize **hooks** (e.g., `before`, `after`, `beforeEach`, `afterEach`) in test cases.
- Write unit tests for asynchronous functions.
- Write integration tests for small Node.js servers.
